Freetime hacking project with three purposes:

1) Learn basics of VUE toolkit (== client part)
2) Learn basics of TypeScript language (== server part)
3) Purposed is to have a photo-browsing software accesible in my home network only (long term "dream" to make this actually usable)

Current (29.01.2022) state: initial experiments on (1) and (2).

Not to be used as an example of good quality SW :-)
